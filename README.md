# FreeTodayNycParks

Every day, all year round, there are free events happening in public parks throughout the five boroughs of New York City. Whether it's around the corner from you or at the other end of your least favorite subway line, this gem will let you discover it for yourself by presenting today's events to you in a readable format.

Occasionally an event will charge a nominal fee or require a membership, so you have the option of viewing only free events. You can also refine the results by borough, or zoom in find out more about any particular events that catch your eye.
